### Chelonid Alphaherpervirus 5 Phylogeny
Chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) is a herpesvirus associated with fibropapillomatosis (FP) in sea turtles worldwide. ChHV5 has been shown to be a requirement for tumour growth in infectivity trials and molecular tests. Studies on the global phylogeography of ChHV5 have revealed four distinct clades: eastern Pacific, western Atlantic and eastern Caribbean, midwest Pacific, and Atlantic. At regional level studies, for instance in Florida and Hawaii, have recorded distinct variants each differing in prevalence according to site, suggesting a strong geographic influence on ChHV5 prevalence. Studying ChHV5 phylogeny is essential for a better understanding of the emergence of FP. Despite the FP panzoonosis being a burden in Kenya, no molecular studies have been done to characterize the ChHV5 in the region. This mini project will describe the phylogeny of ChHV5 in Kenya using sequences of one of the virus’ genes i.e., glycoprotein B (gB). Besides being implicated in the virus’ virulence, gB is considered the ideal gene for the virus’ phylogenetic studies because it codes for glycoproteins present on the viral surface hence in direct contact with the host immune response which, if it exerts any selective pressure, may drive genetic variability. The gene is >2.8MB and has been amplified using four sets of overlapping primers, each producing about 800bp amplicon, to allow sequencing by Sanger. Besides these sequences (to be provided), students will be required to acquire more publicly available sequences to examine relatedness of the Kenyan dataset with published clades and strains.
