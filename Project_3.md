## Long Reads Whole Genome Assembly

This are sequences from E.coli cultures that were isolated from various livestock and humans. All of the sequenced ones were phenotypically resistant to colistin, a last resort drug for treatment of human and livestock bacterial infections.
 
The analysis goals: 
- Genome assembly and polishing 
- Annotation 
- Genome map (Chromosomal and plasmids)
- Analysis of antimicrobial resistance genes
- Analysis of virulence genes, mobile genetic elements
- Sequence type analysis
 
 
The data is already on the pwani cluster, the data from all the 12 samples will be made available to the group that will be using it.
