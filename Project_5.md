### Antelope Phylogenetics
We are currently facing a biodiversity crisis worldwide, and as such there is a pressing need to effectively preserve the planets remaining species. However, in order to conserve a species you need to know it exists in the first place. Whilst this is straightforward in well studied fauna such as elephants, DNA sequencing has revealed in recent years the existence of multiple cryptic species of animals hiding in plain sight, as seen with red pandas (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aax5751) and giraffes (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.07.036). The focus of this mini project is to analyse mitochondrial cytB sequences (to be provided) collected from the Galana Wildlife Conservancy from gerenuk, waterbuck, dik-dik and impala, and see if these sequences match to existing sequences on Genbank via BLAST. In order to further examine if any of these antelope in Galana are distinct populations or cryptic species, the students will use a phylogenetic approach to look at the evolutionary history of each antelope sampled. This will involve downloading corresponding sequences from Genbank, aligning the sequences, running a model test and generating a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.

The results from this analysis will then inform whether any of the antelopes sampled in the Galana Wildlife Conservancy are a distinct population or undescribed species warranting further protection.
